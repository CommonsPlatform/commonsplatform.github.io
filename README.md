### Contributing to the Commons Platform website

If you want to contribute to this website please speak to Sophie and Nick.

### Working from GitHub issues is required 

There must be a GitHub issue for anything you work on. If you can't find an existing GitHub issue, after discussing with one of the maintainers listed as contacts in the README, feel free to take the initiative and create one yourself. By having a GitHub issue for all ongoing tasks will give oversight to all volunteer activities, not just for the maintainers so they can track progress but for other volunteers as well so they can see where work is at, enabling volunteers to clearly see where and how they can contribute.

Please also give periodic updates. Every two weeks is a good rule of thumb.

### Posting your work to GitHub, where possible, is required

If you are working on something that will produce code, a document (even non technical documents like checklists for event planning etc.), a file, anything that can be saved rather can contributions like posting to social media etc., it's asked you post the material to GitHub. This will give oversight to your work, not just for the maintainers so they can track progress but for other volunteers as well so they can see where work is at, enabling volunteers to clearly see where and how they can contribute.

Please also give periodic updates. Every two weeks is a good rule of thumb.

### Comments are required

If your contribution will take place in any way on GitHub or you use Git please read over [this](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) blogpost. It's heavy on using Git from the command line but the fundamentals are still relevent. Comments make things easier for everyone, so please leave comments when making commits. Taken from the aforementioned blogpost, please follow these seven rules:

* Separate subject from body with a blank line (Github does this automatically)
* Limit the subject line to 50 characters (GitHub will warn you of this but not restrict you)
* Capitalize the subject line
* Do not end the subject line with a period
* Use the imperative mood in the subject line (your subject should be able to complete the following sentence: If applied, this commit will *your subject line here*)
* Wrap the body at 72 characters
* Use the body to explain what and why vs. how (unless the title is explanation enough, in which case leave the body out)

Examples:

Stop Embark crashing (*"If applied, this commit will stop embark crashing"* is a workable sentence as per the above rule)

This addition to the flux capacitor stablises Embark.

or the one liner:
