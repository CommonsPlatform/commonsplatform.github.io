# What is the Commons? 

[The Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons) is the cultural and natural resources accessible to all members of a society. There can be many differnt types of Commons, such as environmental resources like land, air and water, cultural and intellectual commons like literature, music, arts and design, digital commons such as the Internet, urban commons such as shared urban spaces and knowledge commons like bodies of scientific research.

# What is the difference between Free and Libre?

The English adjective free is commonly used in one of two meanings: ["for free" (gratis) and "with little or no restriction" (libre)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratis_versus_libre). As the two are differnt they must be differentiated.

# What is a steward and stewardship?

A [steward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewardship) is someone that embodies the ethics of stewardship, the planning and management of resources. The concepts of stewardship can be applied across many areas, to the environment and nature, economics, health, property, information, even theology and other areas. 

# What does centralisation and decentralisation mean?

[Centralisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centralisation) is the process by which the activities of an organization, particularly those regarding planning and decision-making, become concentrated within a particular location or group. Centralisation runs counter to the ideals of the Commons Platform in many ways:

* As there is only one point of truth it can become difficult to confirm that the instruction is correct if you don't have access to that point of truth. In this situation, people lack the ability to make a decision for themselves. 
* Attentions and support across different parties may not be balanced.
* As there is a single point of truth, bottlenecks can delay work.
* Discrepancies in resources between the centre and other areas are usually significant.
* Many actors are often excluded from the decision making, reducing the capacity of single point of truth to resolve disputes or design effective plans requiring personalised knowledge and expertise.

[Decentralisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralization) on the other hand, is the process by which activities like planning and decision-making, are shifted away from a single point of truth. Decentralisation is preferred by the Commons Platform as it addresses the above mentioned problems in the below ways:

* As there are multiple points of the same truth, which is group concensus, it is easy to check what the consensus is. If there are any issues, groups have the abilites to make their own decisions.
* Attention and support across different parties should be more equal as many parties get a say in the distribution.
* Bottlenecks are rarer as many people are empowered to make decisions.
* Discrepancies in resources between different areas should be be reduced as again, many parties get a say in the distribution and there is no centre to restrict the allocation of resources.
* Different actors are included in decision making, allowing the most effective plans requiring personalised knowledge and expertise to be created.
