# Quotes

"This is a time when business, technology and our systems of social engagement have lost their way through overlooking their own values and the needs of the people that they are supposedly serving and who are generating their income. We need sustainable and workable models of genuine collaboration, with integrity, respect and values at their core for very practical reasons - this is part of building a sustainable culture with long term vision, also financially, where people are genuinely represented and where their unique gifts and contributions are included. We've only just scratched the surface in terms of what is possible in collaborative structures/enterprises" – Emma Stow, Commons Platform community member. - full quote


"Common stewardship is the antidote to the tragedy of the privates" - Christian Stuart Keegan, Commons Platform community member.

“I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons will live together in harmony and with equal opportunities” - Nelson Mandela

"What I need is a life that is gentle. A world that is kind and people who are soft. A mind that is safe from violence, both social and internal." Jenny Crofton\

“You never change things by fighting against the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model Obsolete.”
        Richard Buckminster Fuller

“The secret of change is to focus all your energy, not on fighting the old, but on building the
new"- Socrates

Today (1968) functional problems are becoming less simple all the time. But designers rarely confess their inability to solve them. Instead, when a designer does not understand a problem clearly enough to find the order it really calls for, he falls back on some arbitrarily chosen formal order. The problem, because of its complexity, remains unsolved. —Christopher Alexander, Notes on Synthesis and Form

Shameless
To be in favour or disgrace
Is to live in fear.
To take the body seriously 
Is to admit one can suffer.

What does that mean,
To be in favour or disgrace
Is to live in fear?
Favour debases:
We fear to lose it,
Fear to win it.
So to be in favour or disgrace
Is to live in fear.

What does that mean,
To take the body seriously
Is to admit one can suffer?
I suffer because I am a body;
If I weren’t a body,
How could I suffer?

So people who set their bodily good
Before the public good
Could be entrusted with the commonwealth,
And people who treated the body politic
As gently as their own body
Would be worthy to govern the commonwealth.
Lao Tzu, Tao Te Ching Ch 13 
(Translation Ursula K. Le Guin)


Techniques
Can you keep your soul in its body,
hold fast to the one,
and so learn to be whole?
Can you center your energy,
be soft, tender,
and so learn to be a baby?
Can you keep the deep water still and clear,
so it reflects without blurring?
Can you love people and run things,
and do so by not doing?
Opening, closing the gate of the Universe,
can you be like a bird with her nestlings?
Piercing bright through the cosmos,
can you know by not knowing?
To give birth, to nourish,
to bear and not to won,
to act and not lay claim,
to lead and not rule:
this is the mysterious power.
Lao Tzu, Tao Te Ching Ch 10 
(Translation Ursula K. Le Guin)

Out there beyond ideas of rightdoing and wrongdoing is a field. I’ll meet you there. 
Rumi

Author James P. Carse in Finite and Infinite Games: “A finite game is played for the purpose of winning, an infinite game for the purpose of continuing the play.”
