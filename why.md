“I tell you what freedom is to me: no fear” - Nina Simone, singer, song writer, activist.

- We need technology that is transparent in how it treats its users and their data.

“If you could get a Facebook where your data wasn’t mined and sold on to corporations people would start using it tomorrow” Matt Kennard, Real Media.

- We need a social media platform that helps users build true and meaningful connections.

"...We need sustainable and workable models of genuine collaboration, with integrity, respect and values at their core for very practical reasons..." - Emma Stow, Commons Platform community member.

- We need an economic system that is equitable.

"A community marketplace of ideas and resources" - Lance, Commons Platform community member.

- We need to build ethics into our technology.

"This brings with it the risk that this exciting new sector will be dominated by the large digital platforms who currently dominate the internet... It will reduce the overall size of the AI market and the benefits that AI could bring to all of us" - Peter Wells, Head of Policy, Open Data Institute (ODI)
