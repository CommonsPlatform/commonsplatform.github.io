# Why the Commons Platform?

- We need a template for building and maintaining the [Commons](https://commonsplatform.github.io/terms/#what-is-the-commons). 
- We need a [free and libre](https://commonsplatform.github.io/terms/#what-is-the-difference-between-free-and-libre) social media platform.
- We need technology that is transparent in how it treats its users and their data.
- We need a social media platform that helps users build true and meaningful connections.
- We need an economic system that is equitable.

Common stewardship is the antidote to the tragedy of the privates - Christian Stuart Keegan, Commons Platform community member.

- We need to build ethics into our technology.
